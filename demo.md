# ClickUp MCP Endpoint - Demo Summary

## 🎯 **What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?**
A unified AI-powered endpoint that intelligently routes user requests between **searching existing tickets** and **creating new tickets** using natural language processing.

## 🚀 **Key Features & Demo Points**

### 1. **Intelligent Intent Detection**
```
User Input: "Are there any bugs created today?"
→ AI detects: SEARCH intent
→ Routes to: Search functionality

User Input: "The login button is broken"
→ AI detects: CREATE intent  
→ Routes to: Ticket creation
```

### 2. **Advanced Natural Language Search**
- **Basic Search**: `"find high priority bugs assigned to john created last week"`
- **AI Extracts**:
  - Query: "bugs"
  - Assignee: "john"
  - Priority: "high"
  - Date range: Last 7 days
  - Status filters automatically applied

- **NEW: Limit & Ordering Support**: `"show me the 10 newest tickets"`
- **AI Extracts**:
  - Query: "tickets"
  - Limit: 10 results
  - Order by: "created" (newest first)
  - Smart ordering detection

### 3. **Smart Ticket Creation**
- **Input**: `"The payment system is down and users can't checkout"`
- **AI Generates**:
  - Type: "bug" (detected from context)
  - Priority: "urgent" (payment system = critical)
  - Structured description with acceptance criteria
  - Appropriate tags and complexity estimation

### 4. **Single Endpoint Simplicity**
```
POST /mcp
{
  "prompt": "Any natural language request",
  "teamId": "optional-team-id"
}
```
